# SCDM

This repository includes the codes and descriptions of the Self-Control Development agent-based Model (SCDM) discussed in the article "Looking at Self-Control Development in Adolescence Through Dynamic Systems Concepts: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach" (submitted). 

A comprehensive description of the model is available in the ODD.html file (using the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) protocol for describing individual- and agent-based models (Grimm et al. 2006), as updated by Grimm et al. (2020)).

Moreover, you can find a detailed discussion of the systematic experiments we carried out with the model and access the results in the SimulationData directory.
